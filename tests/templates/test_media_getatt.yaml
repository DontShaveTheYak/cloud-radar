Description: "Basic template to check GetAtt behaviours"

Resources:
  MediaPackageV2Channel:
    Type: AWS::MediaPackageV2::Channel
    Metadata:
      Cloud-Radar:
        attribute-values:
        # When unit testing there are no real AWS resources created, and cloud-radar
        # does not attempt to realistically generate attribute values - a string is always
        # returned. This works good enough most of the time, but there are some cases where
        # if you are attempting to apply intrinsic functions against the attribute value
        # it needs to be more correct.
        #
        # In this case, the attribute value is expected to be a List, not a string.
